# On-Screen-Virtual-Keyboard

This is an On screen virtual keyboard. We use OpenCV to create this project.

With the requirement of conducting online virtual lectures and examinations, this project can come handy for teachers to record lectures while using a virtual marker to add an interactive depth to the tutorial virtually.
